# This is my crappy group video chat app
## It crashes your entire computer several seconds after another user joins the room you are in...
## Not using redis client correctly either

I have been trying to fix the crash, but have only managed to make it happen later.
Also the video for all the other users disappears when you start typing in the chat, for some reason...
